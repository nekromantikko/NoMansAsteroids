# No Man's Asteroids

Summer project 2020

I wanted to learn Vulkan so I made a PBR renderer as a summer project, and later made a very simple asteroids type game where you mine gold. It has an infinite universe with random generation similar to No Man's Sky, hence the name.
In hindsight, asteroids is maybe not the best demo project for a PBR renderer, but it is what it is.
